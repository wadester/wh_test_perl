WH Test Perl Repository -- Perl examples and test files

Summary:
========

This is a simple repository with multiple sample Perl programs.  These are 
simple programs that may be used as examples for writing Perl programs.  
This project may be public, but it does not yet serve any specific purpose.  
It may in the future....  At this point it includes a bunch of sample 
Perl programs, some based on Perl examples.

    loosely based on my wh_test_py github repository.
