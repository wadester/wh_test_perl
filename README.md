Summary:
--------

This is a simple repository with multiple sample Perl programs.  These are 
simple programs that may be used as examples for writing Perl programs.  
This project may be public, but it does not yet serve any specific purpose.  
It may in the future....  At this point it includes a bunch of sample 
Perl programs, some based on Perl examples.

History:
--------

  N/A (created 10/6/2015 based on much earlier Perl examples)

Notes:
------

1.  This document is in a parsable format similar to asciidoc.  I have used
    this format for MANY years (I may upload a tool or migrate to asciidoc).

2.  This project is mainly to experiment with github and with Perl.  It is
    loosely based on my wh_test_py github repository.

3.  License for ALL files is GPL, see LICENSE.

4.  Please e-mail me with any updates, suggestions, etc.

5.  Programs include TBD.

6.  After running the programs, run make clean to remove test files.
